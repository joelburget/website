<h1>Slimlock: Unholy Screen Locker</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Slimlock is a simple screen locker that borrows the interface of <a href="http://slim.berlios.de/">SLiM</a>. It automatically reads your SLiM configuration to lock your screen with the same theme you use to log in.</p>
<h2>Why would I use it?</h2>
<p>It's lightweight, but not too much. You could try <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeScreensaver">gnome-screensaver</a>, but that would be silly if you don't have the rest of gnome installed. There are other lighter screen lockers, for instance <a href="http://tools.suckless.org/slock">slock</a> and <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">xscreensaver</a>. But xscreensaver is too gaudy for me and slock is too minimal. Here are screenshots comparing slock and slimlock:</p>

<p>Yes, that's right. Slock is just a black screen that goes away if you enter the password correctly. It's kind of cool but it makes me uncomfortable. I could picture someone coming along and shutting down my computer because the screen is locked but they think it's frozen.</p>
<p>I also thought it would be neat to make it match the login screen I use when starting my computer, kind of like Windows... Thus slimlock was born. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Get It</h2>
