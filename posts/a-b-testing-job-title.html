    A few people have asked me about this story. Most of it happened over a year ago and probably half of our organization has joined Khan Academy since then. I'm writing this so I have a place to point people when they ask why I'm "the dinosaur guy".
</p>

<p>
One of the great things about Khan Academy is that the organization is informal. In particular they're relatively unconcerned with titles.
</p>

<p>
One day I decided that while being a "Software Developer" is a rewarding career, it fails to project the right air of whimsy and adventure. I needed a new job title and the users were going to tell me what it would be.
</p>

<p>
A day later I had an A/B test rigged up and running live on the site. One control (following the scientific method, of course) and three alternatives would statistically determine the optimum job title.

        Joel studies dinosaurs when he should be doing real work. He'll make Jurassic Park a reality one of these days.

<h2>Sabotage</h2>

<img src="/media/img/tampering.png" alt="suspicious results" width="800px">

<p>
Life's not perfect at Khan Academy, though. One day I noticed an aberration in the results. It wasn't clear at first whether this was a bug in our A/B testing framework or I was the victim of corporate espionage.
</p>

<p>
A little digging showed that the saboteur was a Khan Academy employee. The intrigue! Grey-hat hacker <a href="http://www.stchangg.com/">stchangg</a> had written a proof of concept revealing our A/B testing framework gameable by bots. Developers are dear leaders, friends are enemies - we've just waded into murky ethical waters. We may be in over our heads.
</p>

<h2>Business Cards</h2>

</div>

<p>
I eventually ended up with ridiculous business cards. By the way I'm kind of embarrassed about these now - I'm trying to project a more professional image (not that this post will help) - so I wouldn't mind getting rid of them. So let me know if you want one. They're limited edition!
